# FormulaGuard — Beta Test Brief (Formulator Test)

## 1. Short Introduction

**Who this tool is for:** FormulaGuard is designed for cosmetic formulators, product developers, and anyone creating natural cosmetic formulations who needs to ensure their recipes are safe, compliant, and properly calculated.

**What FormulaGuard is:** A formulation tool that helps you build cosmetic formulas with automatic percentage calculations, batch scaling, and compliance guardrails. It validates your ingredient percentages, checks safety limits, and helps you create properly balanced formulations.

**What FormulaGuard is NOT:** This is not a regulatory database or a substitute for professional regulatory review. FormulaGuard provides helpful guardrails and calculations, but final compliance decisions should always be verified with appropriate regulatory resources.

**How to test:** As you work through the tasks below, please think out loud. Share what you're looking for, what you expect to happen, and any moments of confusion or clarity. Your honest reactions help us understand how real formulators will use this tool.

## 2. Test Setup

- **Login credentials:** We will provide you with test account credentials separately.
- **Testing approach:** Use FormulaGuard as if you're creating a real cosmetic formula for a product you might actually make.
- **Device:** Desktop or laptop preferred for the best experience.

## 3. Test Tasks

Please complete these five tasks in order:

1. **Create a simple leave-on cream formula**
   - Start a new formula and select appropriate product type and skin type.
   - Add several common ingredients (e.g., water, oils, emulsifiers, preservatives).

2. **Adjust percentages until total is 100%**
   - Modify ingredient percentages so the formula totals exactly 100%.
   - Observe how the tool responds as you make changes.

3. **Add at least one active ingredient**
   - Include an active or functional ingredient (e.g., a botanical extract, vitamin, or specialty ingredient).
   - Note how the tool handles this addition.

4. **Trigger at least one compliance warning**
   - Adjust an ingredient percentage to exceed a recommended safety limit, if possible.
   - Review how the warning is presented and whether it's clear what action to take.

5. **Try to export or save the formula**
   - Complete your formula and attempt to save or export it.
   - Note the available options and how the process feels.

## 4. Feedback Checklist

Please comment on the following areas:

- **Workflow clarity:** Is it clear what to do next at each step? Can you easily navigate between different parts of the tool?
- **Error and compliance messages:** When warnings or errors appear, are they understandable? Do you know what they mean and what to do about them?
- **Percentages and totals:** Do the percentage calculations feel intuitive? Is it easy to see how your changes affect the total?
- **Confusion or frustration:** Were there any moments where you felt stuck, confused, or frustrated? What happened?
- **Missing functionality:** Is there anything clearly missing that you would need for real formulation work?

## 5. Important Notes

- **There are no wrong answers:** Your honest experience is what matters most. If something feels off, that's valuable feedback.
- **Negative feedback is valuable:** We want to hear what doesn't work or what feels confusing. This helps us improve the tool before launch.
- **Focus on usability, not features:** For this test, please focus on how the current features work and feel. We're not collecting feature requests at this stage—we want to make sure what we have is clear and usable first.

Thank you for your time and thoughtful feedback!
